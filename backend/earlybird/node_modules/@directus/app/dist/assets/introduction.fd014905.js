var e="# Directus Docs\n\n> These Docs will help you get up-and-running quickly, guide you through advanced features, and explain the core\n> concepts that make Directus so unique.\n\n::: tip Version 9\n\nThis is the documentation for the new **[Directus 9](https://github.com/directus/directus)** platform written in\nNode.js. If you are looking for the previous **[Directus 8](https://github.com/directus/v8-archive/releases/latest)**\n(PHP) docs, you can find them [here](https://v8.docs.directus.io).\n\n:::\n\n## What is Directus?\n\n**Directus is an Open Data Platform for managing the content of any SQL database. It provides a powerful API layer for\ndevelopers and an intuitive App for non-technical users.** Written entirely in JavaScript (primarily\n[Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)), Directus is completely open-source, modular, and\nextensible, allowing it to be fully tailored to the requirements of any project.\n\nThe platform can be used for an individual purpose, such as headless content management, or more broadly to democratize\nan entire organization's data (customers, inventory, business intelligence, projects, etc).\n\n::: tip What's in a name?\n\n\"Directus\" ([duh REKT iss](http://audio.pronouncekiwi.com/Salli/Directus)) is Latin for: _laid straight, arranged in\nlines_. The broadest goal of our platform is to present data in a simple, orderly, and intuitive way.\n\n:::\n\n## Database Mirroring\n\n**What makes Directus so unique is that it dynamically generates custom API endpoints based on your SQL database's\nschema in real-time — something we call \"[Database Mirroring](/concepts/databases/#database-mirroring)\".** Whether you\ninstall fresh or on top of an existing database, you always maintain end-to-end control over your actual database,\nincluding: tables, columns, datatypes, default values, indexes, relationships, etc.\n\nBelow is an overview to how Directus mirrors the database, and our non-technical naming convention.\n\n- **[Project](/concepts/projects/)** — A Database (also includes asset storage and the config file)\n- **[Collection](/concepts/collections/)** — A Database Table\n- **[Fields](/concepts/fields/)** — A Database Column\n- **[Item](/concepts/items/)** — A Database Record/Row\n- **[Relationships](/concepts/relationships/)** — A Database Relationship, including additional non-standard types\n- **[Type](/concepts/types/)** — A Database Data Type, including additional non-standard types\n- **[Users](/concepts/users/)** — A Directus User (App or API), not to be confused with a Database User\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest advantages of _Database Mirroring_ is that you have direct access to your pure and unaltered\ndata. That means you have the option to bypass the Directus middleware (API, SDK, App) and connect to your data with\nproper SQL queries. This effectively removes all bottlenecks, latency overhead, and proprietary access limitations.\n\n## Modular & Extensible\n\nWhat makes Directus so flexible is that it has been designed from the ground up with complete extensibility, helping\navoid a feature ceiling. In addition to offering our software's codebase as open-source, we've included the following\nextension types in the platform's App and API.\n\n- **[Modules](/concepts/modules/)** — (App) The highest and broadest level of organization within the App\n- **[Layouts](/concepts/layouts/)** — (App) How you browse, view or interact with a set of Items in a Collection\n- **[Interfaces](/concepts/interfaces/)** — (App) How you view or interact with a field and its value\n- **[Displays](/concepts/displays/)** — (App) A small inline preview of a field's value\n- **[Panes](#)** — (App) A way to view dashboard data within the Insights Module\n- **[Styles](/guides/styles/)** — (App) Whitelabeling through App Themes and CSS Overrides\n- **[Endpoints](/guides/api-endpoints/)** — (API) Custom registered API endpoints\n- **[Hooks](/guides/api-hooks/)** — (API) Event and interval hooks for triggering custom logic\n- **[Email Templates](/guides/email-templates/)** — (API) Custom structure and formatting for emails\n\n## Core Principles\n\nDirectus is a simple solution for complex problems, with a data-first approach guided by the following core principles:\n\n- **Pure** — There is no predefined model or proprietary rules for your schema, and all system settings are stored\n  separately.\n- **Open** — Our entire codebase is public and transparent, allowing for end-to-end audits. Nothing is obfuscated or\n  black-boxed.\n- **Portable** — Data is stored in your bespoke database and can be migrated/exported/backed-up at any time. Absolutely\n  no vendor lock-in.\n- **Limitless** — Create unlimited users, roles, languages, collections, and items. No arbitrary restrictions or paywall\n  limitations.\n- **Extensible** — Every aspect of the platform is modular, allowing you to adapt, customize, and infinitely extend the\n  Core engine.\n- **Unopinionated** — Choose your database (all SQL vendors), API (REST or GraphQL), and infra (self-hosted or Cloud).\n\n## The Directus Ecosystem\n\n### Open-Source Core\n\nOur completely free and open-source (GPLv3) Open Data Platform.
