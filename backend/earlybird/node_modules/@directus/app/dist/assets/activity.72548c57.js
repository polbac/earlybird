var e="# Activity\n\n> Directus stores detailed records of all data changes made via the App and API. This gives a comprehensive\n> accountability log of who did what, and when. This also powers the Directus versioning system, which allows storing\n> alternate versions/revisions of items.\n\nThe Activity Log tracks all events that have occurred within the project. Activity can be accessed in two ways, via the\nmain [Activity Module](/concepts/application/#activity-log), or within the sidebar of individual\n[Item Detail](/concepts/application/#item-detail) pages. The following information is stored for each event's activity\nitem:\n\n## Activity Fields\n\n- **User** — The Directus user that performed the action\n- **Action** — The specific action taken, eg: Create, Update, Delete, Authenticate\n- **TimeStamp** — The timestamp of when the action was performed\n- **IP Address** — The IP address of the device from which the action was performed\n- **User Agent** — The description of the browser that was used to perform the action\n- **Collection** — The Collection affected by the action\n- **Item** — The item (within the above Collection) affected by the action\n- **Comment** — When applicable; the comment left by the user\n\n::: tip Readonly\n\nFor proper accountability, activity records are readonly. Administrators should avoid changing, deleting, or truncating\nthis data.\n\n:::\n\n::: warning External Events\n\nDirectus can only track events that pass through the platform's middleware. Changes made directly to the database, or by\nother external means, are not included.\n\n:::\n";export{e as default};
